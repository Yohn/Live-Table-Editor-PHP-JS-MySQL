Hi Programmers, Welcome to gilgeekify, my name is Saeed Kohansal, and I hope you have a wonderful day, In this video, I will teach you how to create a Live Table Editor like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets From Scratch Using HTML, CSS, Core PHP, Vanilla JavaScript, and MySQL Database, With my Live Table Editor You can edit your data in database directly from an HTML table in Real-Time without any page refresh, In the Client-Side, I will show you how to use JavaScript Fetch API to make network requests, and in the Server-Side, I'm gonna show you how to create PHP backend REST API to connect with database and handle your requests, It's a video about Full-Stack Web Development and Database. So We're going to connect Front-End To Back-End API. I'm using JSON data and REST architecture, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is readable and easily parsed by machines. JSON is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language. Representative State Transfer (REST) is a client-server architectural style that uses the HTTP protocol in a simple and effective way. Systems that adhere to REST practices are often referred to as RESTful interfaces. RESTful interfaces use the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and so on, that web browsers use to access web pages.
